# Website for my blog

A minimalistic personal blog and learning documentation website built with Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript.



## Tools used

Some ui components are from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/):

- [Breadcrumb](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/breadcrumb)
- [Button](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button)
- [Navigation Menu](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/navigation-menu)
- [Accordion](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion)
- [Separator](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/separator)
- [Hover Card](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/hover-card)

## To-Do

- [ ] Make the navbar sticky for mobile and make the navbar move its original Y position a little higher and stick to the very top when the user scrolls down
- [ ] Add a search bar
- [ ] Add a graph visualization (similar to the [Obsidian graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view))
- [ ] Add a "On this page" (like a ToC) section to the top right of the page in the PC version. It should be hidden on mobile.
